What I want/need to do.

- Add the 3 pills back below the ride name.
  - Each ride should have 3 attributes based on [X] amount of attributes that will
    be available to use whenever describing a ride.
  - Will be used for filtering.
  - Add to object being sent from the server.

- Add animation whenever wait time changes. This will include the wait time itself 
  AND the whole panel when it changes it's style based on the new wait time.

- When the user refreshes the page, the park should be the same as before the refreshes.
  - LocalStorage?

- Use GSAP?
