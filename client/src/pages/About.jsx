      <h3>My Theme Park Journey</h3>

      <p>
        Growing up, I never really understood the appeal of theme parks—and I
        absolutely hated roller coasters. They were too fast, too high, and far
        too upside down for my liking. Every couple of years my parents would
        drag me to Six Flags, hoping I’d finally conquer my fear. But the truth
        was, I never got on a ride, and eventually I started questioning why
        they kept trying. Eventually, we stopped going, and through the rest of
        my teenage years I barely thought about theme parks at all. That changed
        when I met my fiancée, who happens to be obsessed with Disney. I grew up
        watching Disney Channel and had a few old VHS tapes, but Disney was
        never a big part of my life. Early in our relationship, she convinced me
        to take a trip with her to Orlando, Florida, to spend a few days at Walt
        Disney World. And wow—did that trip change everything. At first, I still
        wouldn’t get on the rides, even with her begging me to try. But being in
        the parks with someone who truly appreciated the magic made me see them
        in a whole new light. By the time we got home, I already knew I wanted
        to go back. Since then, we’ve returned four times, and with each trip
        I’ve pushed myself a little more. I started riding smaller attractions,
        then coasters like Slinky Dog Dash and Space Mountain. Now, my all-time
        favorite is Big Thunder Mountain. I love the theming, the storytelling,
        and the immersion Disney brings to its attractions. Not every park can
        match Disney’s level of detail, but I’ve come to appreciate the effort
        and creativity that all parks put into their rides. What started as fear
        has turned into a genuine love for the magic of theme parks—and it’s all
        thanks to seeing them through someone else’s eyes.

      <h3>Special Thanks</h3>



      <p>
        I graduated with a degree in Software Development and have been working
        on this idea ever since. I realize that this is not the first and won't
        be the last time that a website would employ this idea, but I wanted to
        make one myself and update with more features as I grow as a developer.
        This site is using wait time info provided by{" "}
        <a href="https://queue-times.com/">Queue Times</a>, and I am very
        grateful that they provide an API for developers to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        And of course I would thank my beautiful fiance, soon to be wife, for
        introducting me to the magic that can come from theme parks and all of
        their attractions!
